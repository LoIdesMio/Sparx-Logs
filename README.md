# Sparx-Logs
This code is to quickly add all the log things in Sparx
Please create a Doc then click Extensions > AppScript

And add CreateSparxLogs.gs to the files.
On line 4 in the array change the numbers according to how many questions in every section of your Sparx Homework
e.g Your first part has 7 question so replace with 7 and so on add as many as your homework has :)

That's it hope it was helpful!
